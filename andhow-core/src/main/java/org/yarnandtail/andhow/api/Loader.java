 * values and registering loader-level problems into a LoaderValues object.
 *
 * Implementations may define a set of Properties used to control the behavior
 * of all instances of a loader, which are returned from getClassConfig().
 * During AndHow startup, these parameters will be automatically added to the list of
 * registered Properties. Values for these properties need to be loaded by a
 * preceding loader or <em>forced</em> in the AndHowBuilder.
 *
 * Implementations may also define instance level configuration by returning
 * a list of Properties from getInstanceConfig().  These properties must have been
 * added to the groups added to the AndHow builder via addGroup().
 *
 * Instances should not hold state because they are held in memory for the life
 * of the application.
